# What is GraphEm?

GraphEm is an interactive graphing software, 
designed to help students in visualizing and understanding graph structures 
and graph-related algorithms. 

It allows freely creating, editing, and saving graphs in several formats,
as well as executing Python scripts on the created structures, 
giving students, teachers and developers a full overview over their data and algorithms.

# Goals

Right now the goal is to not abandon the project by the end of the month.
